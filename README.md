# Flipper Zero Compiles App (.fap) Files

## What this is?
Due to popular demand, I've added this repository with compiled FAP files of my Flipper Zero Applications<br>
These can be downloaded and added to your Flipper Zero using qFlipper or by writing directly on to the SD card. 
<br><br>
All Apps were manually compiled on my machine for the corresponding Firmware. Version updates will be done occasianally.
<br><br>
I recommend checking out how to compile source code, as it is much more convenient if you get this running. Brief tutorials<br>
can be found here<br>

## Firmware flavours
I'll try my best to supply versions for the original and the common custom firmwares. Files in the corresponding folder
- Official
- Roguemaster
- Unleashed
- Xtreme

## Offical App Catalog
You can find some of these Applications in the Official Flipper Zero App Catalog. This is embeded into the Mobile App. 

## Alternate Sources
Also checkout the unofficial Flipper App store, that allows you to build and install apps directly from Github to your device
