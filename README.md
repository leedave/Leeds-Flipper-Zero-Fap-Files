# Flipper Zero Compiles App (.fap) Files
 <div style="text-align:center">

## What this is?
Due to popular demand, I've added this repository with compiled FAP files of my Flipper Zero Applications<br>
These can be downloaded and added to your Flipper Zero using qFlipper or by writing directly on to the SD card. 
<br><br>
I recommend checking out how to compile source code, as it is much more convenient if you get this running. Brief tutorials<br>
can be found here<br>
